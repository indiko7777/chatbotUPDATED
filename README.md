# Chat-bot for Speech Analysis

This Python script implements a simple chat-bot by analyzing political speeches. The chat-bot uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis to extract valuable information from a corpus of cleaned speeches. The program offers several functionalities, including extracting president names, processing speeches, searching for presidents who speak the most about a specific word, testing question-related functions, asking a question to the chat-bot, displaying the TF-IDF matrix, and exiting the program.
